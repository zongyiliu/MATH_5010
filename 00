\section*{Homework \# 4}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Do problems 1, 2, and 3 from Section 16.10 .1 of Chapter 16. Each problem is worth 5 points. To receive full credit, you must provide both:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
  \item The R code you used to solve each problem.
  \item Your answers to each question.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{1}
  \item (5pts) Suppose a firm is planning to invest $\$ 1,000,000$ in a combination of a risk-free asset and a risky asset A. Assume:
\end{enumerate}

$$
\mu_{f}=5 \%, \quad \mu_{A}=12 \%, \quad \sigma_{A}=25 \%
$$

The company has capital reserves to cover losses up to $\$ 200,000$, and they want the probability of losing this amount or more to be at most 0.01 .

If the return of the portfolio is:

$$
R=\omega \mu_{A}+(1-\omega) \mu_{f}
$$

and the return is normally distributed, find the value of $\omega$ that satisfies the risk requirement.\\
3. (15pt) The table below gives sample statistics (monthly means, standard deviations, and covariances) for returns on Microsoft, Nordstrom, and Starbucks over the period January 1995 to January 2000.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cccc}
\hline
Asset & $\mu_{i}$ & $\sigma_{i}$ & Covariances \\
\hline
A (Microsoft) & 0.0427 & 0.1000 & $\sigma_{A B}=0.0018$ \\
B (Nordstrom) & 0.0015 & 0.1044 & $\sigma_{A C}=0.0011$ \\
C (Starbucks) & 0.0285 & 0.1411 & $\sigma_{B C}=0.0026$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

(a) (4pt) Find the global minimum variance portfolio. What is its mean? What is its variance?\\
(b) (4pt) Find the efficient portfolio of these assets with the same expected return as Microsoft. What is its risk?\\
(c) (4pt) Assume a risk-free rate of 0.0001 per month (T-bill). What are the weights of the tangency portfolio?\\
(d) (3pt) Find the portfolio made up of the risky assets and the risk-free asset that has the same expected return as Microsoft. What is its risk equal to?
